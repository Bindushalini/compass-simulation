# compass-simulation

This is a Computer graphics project in which the compass the is designed using OpenGl.
The compass has been designed using mid-point circle algorithm and it performs the movement of needle.The needle is controlled using keyboard to show different directions. 
Translation,scaling is also performed on the compass which moves the object and resizes accordingly in uniform measurement.
Rotation function are used to perform the rotation of needles.

Other functionalities:
1. Menu option has been incorporated.
2. Change in background colors is also avalilable.

This project has been implemented in order to demonstrate the working of various transformation functions of OpenGl. All the topics are studied deeply and the code is integrated.
